						<p style="font-size:30px">SP Digital is a very exciting place to be in, I am amazed by how this young company has expanded and grew to the company it is today with just the span of 3 years. One of the main reasons could be that the company was founded by a group of experienced individuals that came together with ideals of what can be done better compared to the company they were previously in. </p>

						<p style="font-size:30px">I think after working here, I really feel that I enjoy doing the role of a web developer and it is a pity that schools do not have like a full time course because I honestly believe that becoming a full stack developer is not easy as there are many things that contribute to sustainability and production ready.</p>

							<h3>Deputy Director, Mr. Sujit Mathew, of SP Digital</h3>
							<p style="font-size:30px">To my supervisor and mentor. Thank you for giving me this internship opportunity at SPD. Observing how you communicate with the different developers in the platform team gives me a better understanding how to manage a tech team. When the team is facing a problem, you will understand their situation and give them advise and different approaches to the team. Beacause of your wealth of knowledge and experience you are able to guess accurately diagnose the solution knowing the symptoms of the problem. </p>

							<h3>Software Engineer, Ms Yap Hong Kheng, of SP Digital</h3>
							<p style="font-size:30px">To my mentor for front-end. Thank you for all the support that you have given to me. I have gained so much knowledge in React and testing libs. I frequently bug you to help me when I get stuck with a task and more than just giving me the answer, you always encourage me to share with you what I have researched and then direct me to what I need to google in order to find the solution.</p>

							<h3>Software Engineer, Mr Jason Lui of SP Digital</h3>
							<p style="font-size:30px">To my mentor for back-end. Thank you for letting me do pair programing in go-lang with you. I personally never touched go-lang before, but you were very patience in guiding me and teaching me go-lang and the structure of postgres. You taught me the importance of understanding the code architecture before making certain changes in the code</p>
