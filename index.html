					<section>
						<p>Singapore Power Digital is a very exciting place to be in, I am amazed by how this young company has expanded and grew to the company it is today with just the span of 3 years. One of the main reasons could be that the company was founded by a group of experienced individuals that came together with ideals of what can be done better compared to the company they were previously in. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>I think after working here, I really feel that I enjoy doing the role of a web developer and it is a pity that schools do not have like a full time course because I honestly believe that becoming a full stack developer is not easy as there are many things that contribute to sustainability and production ready.</p>
